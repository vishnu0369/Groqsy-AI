# Perplexity 2.0

A modern, responsive AI chat interface with integrated web search functionality. Perplexity 2.0 provides a clean UI similar to Perplexity.ai, combining conversational AI with real-time search capabilities

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time AI Responses** - Stream AI responses as they're generated
- **Integrated Web Search** - AI can search the web for up-to-date information
- **Conversation Memory** - Maintains context throughout your conversation
- **Search Process Transparency** - Visual indicators show searching, reading, and writing stages
- **Responsive Design** - Clean, modern UI that works across devices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Perplexity 2.0 follows a client-server architecture:

### Client (Next.js + React)
- Modern React application built with Next.js
- Real-time streaming updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Components for message display, search status, and input handling

### Server (FastAPI + LangGraph)
- Python backend using FastAPI for API endpoints
- LangGraph implementation for conversation flow with LLM and tools
- Integration with Tavily Search API for web searching capabilities
- Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming of AI responses

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API key
- Tavily API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harishneel1/perplexity_2.0.git
   cd perplexity_2.0

2. **Set up the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Configure environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   
4. **Set up the client**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install

### Running the Application

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   uvicorn app:app --reload

2. **Start the client**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev

3. **Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000**   

## üîç How It Works

1. **User sends a message** through the chat interface
2. **Server processes the message** using GPT-4o
3. **AI decides** whether to use search or respond directly
4. If search is needed:
   - Search query is sent to Tavily API
   - Results are processed and provided back to the AI
   - AI uses this information to formulate a response
5. **Response is streamed** back to the client in real-time
6. **Search stages are displayed** to the user (searching, reading, writing)
